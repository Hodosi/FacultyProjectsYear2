The server and client are playing WAR.
  The client sends an integer between 4 and 9 to the server.
  The server receives the number and generates an array of size n x n which it initializes with 0.
  After this the server generates n positions in the matrix (of the type (row, column)) which it initializes with 1 (the positions of the planes).
  The server sends the client a message informing him that the game has started.
  The client sends to the server the position where he thinks an airplane is.
  The server responds to the client:
- with "YES" (the plane was bombed) or "NO" (the plane was not bombed)
- with the number of mistakes
- with the number of non-bombed planes.
  The game continues until the client bombs all the planes or makes 5 mistakes (the severe one counts the mistakes).
  At the end of the game the server sends the client the conclusion of the game.
